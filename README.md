# TensorBoard-LIME-KerasTuner
### The repo records my practice of using three practical tools: TensorBoard, LIME, Keras Tuner.
### TensorBoard is for training process presentation.
### LIME is an interesting tool to reveal/explore the intrinsic function and explanation of deep learning.
### Keras Tuner is a powerful tool to tune multiple parameters in neural nets.
